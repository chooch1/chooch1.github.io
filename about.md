Hi, I'm Joe Choo-Choy. I'm an undergraduate student at Duke University, studying systems biology.

My chief interests are in philosophy, biology, and neuroscience, Effective Altruism \([especially](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/)\).

I am involved in the movement/philosphy/set of ideas that is [Effective Altruism](https://www.effectivealtruism.org).

If the world was free of pathogens (and other global catastrophic risks) you'd find me backpacking around the world with my grandfatherâ€™s vintage Leica M3 film camera taking mediocre photos. I still try to do this when I have time off and get the chance to travel somewhere cool.

My Google Scholar profile can be found [here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=CP6aLusAAAAJ&hl=en).

[My Resume (last updated on Jan. 31st 2020)](../documents/Trenton-Bricken-Resume.pdf)

## Current Projects

* RL Implementations of Active Inference - Independent work with friends - Karl Friston's theory for what the objective function of all living beings is has only just started to influence reinforcement learning. We believe there are large opportunities to further investigate Active Inference and apply new developments in variational inference.

* [PyTorch Discrete Normalizing Flows](https://github.com/TrentBrick/PyTorchDiscreteFlows) - Winter Break 2019 - Learning about Discrete Normalizing Flows from "Discrete Flows: Invertible Generative Models of Discrete Data", by Dustin Tran et al. <https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10347.pdf>, I tried implementing them using the coded provided in [edward2](https://github.com/google/edward2/tree/master/edward2/tensorflow/layers#4-reversible-layers) but found that [none of it worked](https://github.com/google/edward2/issues/148). I ended up porting all of the code into PyTorch which required making a number of modifications and getting it working on a toy example. This remains a work in progress.

* Protein Generation and Optimization - Supervised by Dr. Debora Marks's Lab as my Senior Thesis - This research is motivated by the promise of recent developments in our ability to predict protein functionality and the problem of finding novel sequences that maximize this prediction. We are developing a new solution using invertible neural networks and variational inference to approximate the intractable distribution of any protein function predictor with reason to believe this will outperform Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods. Having approximated the underlying distribution, we hope to use Bayesian experimental design to efficiently explore the most promising discovered sequences.

* RL Learning Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) Consensus Protocols - Supervised by Dr. Kartik Nayak, Final Class Project turned research project - Investigating the ability for deep reinforcement learning agents to discover and prove BFT consensus protocols.

## Past Projects (see [GitHub]())

* [Facebook Chatbot for Spaced Repetition Learning](https://github.com/TrentBrick/MMRY) - HackDuke 2016 - Spaced Repetition is wonderful and highly neglected (<https://www.gwern.net/Spaced-repetition>). Can we make it more popular and easy to do routinely using a Facebook Chatbot to both harass and motivate us?
