Hi, I'm Joe Choo-Choy. I'm an undergraduate student at Duke University majoring in systems biology, trying to figure out how to spend my life.

In general, I find myself drawn to interdisciplinary subjects, but my chief curiosities often fall under one of:
- Philosophy: almost anything analytic, from population ethics to mereology. My interest in non-analytic philosophy is similar to my interest in literature more generally.
- Biology: evolution, development, genetics/genomics, virology, immunology.
- Neuroscience/Cognitive Science: theory, computational/algorithmic, development, predictive processing, perceptual psychology, ... 
- [Effective Altruism](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/): a growing global community trying to study and share the best approaches to helping others, with notable connections to animal welfare movements, catastrophic risk reduction, and the [rationality community](https://www.lesswrong.com/).
