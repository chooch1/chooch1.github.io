<p>Hi, Iâ€™m Joe Choo-Choy. Iâ€™m an undergraduate student at Duke University studying systems biology.</p>

<p>In general, I find myself drawn to interdisciplinary subjects, but my chief curiosities often fall under one of:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Philosophy: almost anything analytic, from population ethics to mereology. My interest in non-analytic philosophy is similar to my interest in literature more generally.</li>
  <li>Biology: evolution, development, genetics, {gen, transcript, prote}omics, neurobiology.</li>
  <li>Neuroscience/Cognitive Science: development,</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.effectivealtruism.org/">Effective Altruism</a>: a growing global community trying to study and share the best approaches to philanthropic impact, with notable connections to animal welfare movements, catastrophic risk reduction, and</li>
</ul>
